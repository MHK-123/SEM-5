# 1. Syllabus Breakdown

## 1A. Statistics for ML & Data Science (SFMLDS) — 6 units, 33 hrs

| Unit | Title | Weight (Marks) | Difficulty | Prerequisite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | Statistical Foundations, Covariance, Sampling | ~18% (7 hrs) | Medium | Basic probability, Python |
| II | Statistical Inference, Estimation & Resampling | ~15% (6 hrs) | Hard | Unit I |
| III | Regression, Regularization & Nonlinear Models | ~20% (8 hrs) | Hard | Unit I, II, basic linear algebra |
| IV | Classification & Supervised Learning | ~18% (7 hrs) | Medium-Hard | Unit III |
| V | Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction | ~13% (5 hrs) | Medium | Unit III (linear algebra heavy) |
| VI | Model Evaluation, Bayesian Inference & Ethics | ~15% (6 hrs) | Medium | All previous units |

**Plain English:**
- **Unit I** — How to describe data (mean/median/spread), what shape it takes (distributions), and how to responsibly sample and clean it before doing anything else. This is your toolbox, not a topic to "finish and forget."
- **Unit II** — How confident can you be in a number computed from a sample? Confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, bootstrap — proving a claim is real, not luck.
- **Unit III** — Drawing the best-fit line/curve through data, and stopping it from overfitting (Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net). The heaviest numerical unit.
- **Unit IV** — Sorting things into categories instead of predicting numbers. Logistic regression, k-NN, trees, ensembles, SVMs.
- **Unit V** — Reducing "columns" of data down to what matters (PCA), and grouping similar rows together (clustering) without being told the answer.
- **Unit VI** — How to judge if your model is actually good, plus Bayesian thinking and ML ethics (bias, privacy).

## 1B. Artificial Intelligence & Soft Computing (AISC) — 6 units, 39 hrs

| Unit | Title | Weight | Difficulty | Prerequisite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | Intro to AI & Soft Computing | ~13% (5 hrs) | Easy | None |
| II | Solving Problems by Searching | ~18% (7 hrs) | Medium | Unit I, basic data structures |
| III | Knowledge & Reasoning | ~18% (7 hrs) | Hard | Unit II |
| IV | Fuzzy Set Theory & Fuzzy Rules | ~18% (7 hrs) | Medium-Hard | Basic set theory |
| V | Neural Networks | ~20% (8 hrs) | Hard | Linear algebra, Unit I |
| VI | Hybrid Systems | ~13% (5 hrs) | Medium | Units IV + V |

**Plain English:**
- **Unit I** — What "AI" and "soft computing" mean, why soft computing tolerates imprecision. Definitions-heavy, easy marks.
- **Unit II** — How an AI agent finds a path/solution: DFS/BFS vs A*/Greedy vs Hill Climbing/Simulated Annealing. Expect algorithm tracing questions.
- **Unit III** — Representing facts/rules formally (propositional/predicate logic) and how a machine infers new facts (forward/backward chaining, resolution).
- **Unit IV** — Instead of true/false, degrees of truth. Fuzzification → rules → defuzzification; Mamdani vs Sugeno FIS is a favorite comparison.
- **Unit V** — How neurons learn (Perceptron, Backpropagation, Hebbian learning). Your bridge into real deep learning.
- **Unit VI** — Combining fuzzy + neural + genetic approaches (ANFIS) since each has weaknesses alone.

## 1C. Agile Software Development & DevOps (ASD) — 6 units, 39 hrs

| Unit | Title | Weight | Difficulty | Prerequisite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | Intro to Agile Software Development | ~15% (6 hrs) | Easy | Basic SDLC awareness |
| II | Agile Processes | ~20% (8 hrs) | Medium | Unit I |
| III | Agile Requirements Engineering & Design | ~18% (7 hrs) | Medium | Unit II |
| IV | Agile Planning & Estimation | ~15% (6 hrs) | Medium | Unit III |
| V | Agile Quality Assurance & Testing | ~15% (6 hrs) | Easy-Medium | Unit II |
| VI | DevOps | ~15% (6 hrs) | Medium | Unit V |

**Plain English:**
- **Unit I** — Why Agile exists as a reaction to rigid models. Manifesto + principles are pure memorization but guaranteed marks.
- **Unit II** — The actual flavors of Agile — Scrum, XP, Kanban, Crystal, ASD, TDD, Lean. The core of the subject.
- **Unit III** — How requirements evolve mid-project (backlogs, user stories, story cards) instead of being frozen upfront.
- **Unit IV** — Estimating effort without perfect information — story points, planning poker, velocity, burndown charts.
- **Unit V** — Testing philosophy in Agile: the testing quadrant, TDD, automation pyramid.
- **Unit VI** — DevOps as the natural extension of Agile into deployment: CI/CD pipelines, the 7 Cs.

## 1D. Computer Networks (CN) — 6 units, 39 hrs

| Unit | Title | Weight | Difficulty | Prerequisite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | Introduction to Computer Networks | ~15% (6 hrs) | Easy-Medium | Basic computer fundamentals |
| II | Data Link Layer | ~20% (8 hrs) | Hard | Unit I |
| III | Network Layer | ~23% (9 hrs) | Hard | Unit II |
| IV | Transport Layer | ~18% (7 hrs) | Medium-Hard | Unit III |
| V | Application Layer | ~10% (4 hrs) | Easy | Unit IV |
| VI | Emerging & Advanced Topics | ~13% (5 hrs) | Medium | All previous units |

**Plain English:**
- **Unit I** — Network vocabulary and shape: LAN/MAN/WAN, the OSI and TCP/IP reference models, topologies (bus/star/mesh), transmission media, and core devices (bridge, switch, router, gateway, access point). This is the map you'll place every later unit onto.
- **Unit II** — How two directly-connected machines talk reliably: framing, error detection/correction (parity, checksum, Hamming codes, CRC), flow control (Stop-and-Wait, Sliding Window), and the MAC sublayer (ALOHA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA, WDMA, IEEE 802.3/802.11). Numerical-heavy — CRC and Hamming code problems are the classic "must practice" content here.
- **Unit III** — How data actually finds its way across many networks: switching techniques, IP addressing (classes, IPv4/IPv6, subnetting, supernetting, CIDR, NAT), and routing (static vs dynamic, Distance Vector vs Link State, RIP/OSPF/BGP). The heaviest unit by hours and the one with the most reliable numerical marks (subnetting problems).
- **Unit IV** — Making sure a full message gets from one *process* to another, not just one machine to another: sockets, TCP connection setup/teardown, flow and congestion control, TCP vs UDP, and Quality of Service.
- **Unit V** — The protocols you actually interact with daily without realizing it: HTTP, DNS, email (SMTP/POP3), FTP, TELNET, DHCP, SNMP. Mostly definitional — cheap, guaranteed marks.
- **Unit VI** — Where networking is heading: VPNs, Software-Defined Networking (control/data plane separation, OpenFlow), Network Function Virtualization, and Data Center Network topologies (Fat Tree). This is genuinely current industry content, not legacy theory.

# 2. What Actually Matters

| Subject | High-scoring / Never Skip | Frequently Asked | Mostly Theoretical | Needs Problem-Solving | Can Study Later |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Statistics for ML & Data Science (SFMLDS)** | Regression + Regularization (III), Classification metrics (IV) | Confusion matrix, bias-variance, ROC-AUC, Ridge vs Lasso, MLE | Bayesian ethics, data privacy (VI) | Regression numericals, hypothesis testing calculations, PCA eigen-decomposition | Isolation Forest/LOF (conceptual-only, low weight) |
| **Artificial Intelligence & Soft Computing (AISC)** | Search algorithms (II), Neural Networks (V) | A* vs Greedy, Mamdani vs Sugeno FIS, Backpropagation steps, forward/backward chaining | Unit I definitions, Hybrid systems (VI) | Search tree tracing, fuzzy defuzzification numericals, perceptron weight updates | ANFIS internals (VI) — compare conceptually only |
| **Agile Software Development & DevOps (ASD)** | Agile Processes (II), DevOps (VI) | Scrum roles/ceremonies, Agile Manifesto principles, Testing Quadrant, CI/CD stages | Unit I history, Unit III requirements theory | Story point estimation, burndown chart reading | Self-learning topics like SAFe/LeSS (mention only) |
| **Computer Networks (CN)** | Network Layer (III), Data Link Layer (II) | Subnetting/CIDR problems, OSI vs TCP/IP model, CRC/Hamming code numericals, TCP vs UDP | Unit I device definitions, Unit V protocol lists | Subnetting numericals, CRC/Hamming calculations, routing table tracing, TCP state diagrams | SDN/NFV/DCN specifics (VI) — understand concepts, don't memorize protocol internals |

**Must-never-skip across all subjects:** Regression/classification metrics (SFMLDS), Search + Neural Networks (AISC), Scrum + DevOps pipeline (ASD), Network/Data Link Layer numericals (CN). These four clusters alone likely account for 45–55% of total marks.

---

# 3. Dependency Roadmap (Ignore University Order Where It's Inefficient)

The university's unit order is mostly fine within each subject, with one exception worth fixing: in **SFMLDS**, Unit V (PCA/clustering) is easier to grasp *before* Unit IV's ensemble methods.

### SFMLDS — Recommended Order
```
Unit I: Descriptive Stats & Distributions
        ↓
Unit II: Inference & Hypothesis Testing
        ↓
Unit V: PCA & Clustering (moved up — simpler math, builds feature intuition)
        ↓
Unit III: Regression & Regularization
        ↓
Unit IV: Classification & Supervised Learning
        ↓
Unit VI: Model Evaluation & Bayesian Inference
```

### AISC — University Order Is Already Correct
```
Unit I: AI & Soft Computing Basics → Unit II: Search → Unit III: Knowledge & Reasoning → Unit IV: Fuzzy Systems → Unit V: Neural Networks → Unit VI: Hybrid Systems
```

### ASD — University Order Is Already Correct
```
Unit I: Why Agile → Unit II: Agile Processes → Unit III: Requirements Engineering → Unit IV: Planning & Estimation → Unit V: QA & Testing → Unit VI: DevOps
```

### CN — University Order Is Already Correct (and genuinely well-designed)
```
Unit I: Network Fundamentals & Models
        ↓
Unit II: Data Link Layer (node-to-node reliability)
        ↓
Unit III: Network Layer (routing across networks)
        ↓
Unit IV: Transport Layer (process-to-process delivery)
        ↓
Unit V: Application Layer (what users actually touch)
        ↓
Unit VI: Emerging & Advanced Topics (VPN, SDN, NFV, DCN)
```
**Why:** This is the actual OSI/TCP-IP stack, bottom to top. Each unit is the literal prerequisite for the next — you cannot understand routing (III) without framing/error control (II), and you cannot understand TCP flow control (IV) without knowing what a routed packet even is (III). Don't reorder this one.

# 4. Difficulty Analysis

| Subject | Time to Complete (first pass) | Practice Hours Needed | Memorization (1–10) | Conceptual Depth (1–10) | Coding/Numerical Intensity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SFMLDS** | 35–40 hrs | 25–30 hrs | 4 | 8 | High — formulas, derivations, Python (sklearn) |
| **AISC** | 40–45 hrs | 15–20 hrs | 6 | 7 | Medium — search trees, fuzzy calculations, perceptron math |
| **ASD** | 25–30 hrs | 8–10 hrs | 7 | 5 | Low — mostly conceptual, some estimation math |
| **CN** | 35–40 hrs | 20–25 hrs (numericals) | 6 | 6 | High — subnetting, CRC/Hamming, routing table tracing |

**Total realistic first-pass time investment:** ~150 hours of study + ~75–85 hours of practice ≈ 225–235 hours across the semester.

---

# 5. Exam Strategy — ROI Ranking by Unit

| Subject | Unit | Marks Weight | Effort Needed | ROI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SFMLDS | I (Foundations) | Medium | Low | **Highest** |
| SFMLDS | IV (Classification) | High | Medium | **Highest** |
| SFMLDS | V (PCA/Clustering) | Medium | Low-Medium | **Highest** |
| SFMLDS | VI (Evaluation/Ethics) | Medium | Low | **Highest** |
| SFMLDS | III (Regression) | High | High | **Medium** |
| SFMLDS | II (Inference) | Medium | High | **Low** |
| AISC | I (Intro) | Low-Medium | Very Low | **Highest** |
| AISC | II (Search) | High | Medium | **Highest** |
| AISC | IV (Fuzzy) | High | Medium | **Highest** |
| AISC | VI (Hybrid) | Low-Medium | Low | **Highest** |
| AISC | V (Neural Networks) | High | High | **Medium** |
| AISC | III (Logic/Reasoning) | High | High | **Low** |
| ASD | I (Intro/Manifesto) | Medium | Very Low | **Highest** |
| ASD | II (Agile Processes) | High | Low-Medium | **Highest** |
| ASD | V (Testing) | Medium | Low | **Highest** |
| ASD | VI (DevOps) | Medium | Low-Medium | **Highest** |
| ASD | III (Requirements) | Medium | Medium | **Medium** |
| ASD | IV (Planning) | Medium | Medium | **Medium** |
| CN | I (Intro) | Medium | Low | **Highest** |
| CN | V (Application Layer) | Low-Medium | Very Low | **Highest** |
| CN | VI (Emerging Topics) | Medium | Low-Medium | **Highest** |
| CN | IV (Transport Layer) | High | Medium | **Medium** |
| CN | II (Data Link Layer) | High | High (numericals) | **Medium** |
| CN | III (Network Layer) | Highest weight | High (numericals) | **Medium** |

**Reasoning:** For CN specifically, Units I and V are cheap, near-guaranteed marks (definitions, protocol lists). Units II and III carry the most marks but also demand real numerical fluency (CRC/Hamming, subnetting) — these are "Medium ROI" not because they're low-value, but because the effort-to-marks ratio is less favorable than the definitional units; you still cannot skip them, since they're the heaviest-weighted content in the subject. Unit VI, despite being "new/advanced," is actually high-ROI because it's conceptual and comparative (VPN types, SDN vs traditional networking) rather than numerical — cheap marks if you understand the ideas.

# 6. Easy Route (Minimum Effort to Pass Comfortably, 70–80%)

**Study first (highest-yield, lowest-effort):**
- SFMLDS: Unit I, IV, VI
- AISC: Unit I, II, IV
- ASD: Unit I, II, V, VI
- CN: Unit I, V, VI

**Can skip initially (return only if time allows):**
- SFMLDS Unit II derivations (keep only definitions of CI, p-value, MLE)
- AISC Unit III (keep only definitions of PL/FOPL, skip resolution proofs)
- CN Unit III's dynamic routing algorithm derivations (keep subnetting numericals — those are non-negotiable — but deprioritize deep Link State/Distance Vector proofs)

**Revise multiple times (2–3 passes minimum):**
- Confusion matrix + ROC-AUC (SFMLDS)
- Search algorithm comparison table (AISC)
- Scrum ceremonies + roles (ASD)
- Subnetting/CIDR numericals + OSI vs TCP/IP model (CN)

**Minimum prep checklist for 70–80%:**
1. One clean summary sheet per subject covering every Unit I (all four intro units are cheap, guaranteed marks).
2. Master 3 comparison tables per subject (e.g., Ridge vs Lasso; A* vs Greedy; Scrum vs Kanban; OSI vs TCP/IP) — comparison questions are exam favorites across all four subjects.
3. Do only the "must never skip" list from Section 2 — skip everything under "can study later."
4. Practice subnetting problems until they're fast and automatic — this is CN's single highest-frequency numerical type.
5. One past-year paper attempt per subject minimum, timed.

---

# 7. Best Route (Deep Understanding + 90%+ + Real Skill)

### Recommended learning sequence (60-day track — see Section 9 for why this is the realistic default)
```
Weeks 1–2: SFMLDS I→II→V, AISC I→II, ASD I→II, CN I→II
        ↓
Weeks 3–4: SFMLDS III→IV, AISC III→IV, ASD III→IV, CN III→IV
        ↓
Weeks 5–6: SFMLDS VI, AISC V→VI, ASD V→VI, CN V→VI
        ↓
Weeks 7–8: Full revision + mock exams
```

**Extra concepts worth learning outside the syllabus:**
- SFMLDS: Nested cross-validation, SHAP values on a real small dataset
- AISC: How classical search (A*) evolves into modern reinforcement learning
- ASD: How DevOps culture connects to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- CN: How the syllabus's SDN/NFV content connects to real cloud networking (AWS VPCs, load balancers) — this is directly interview-relevant and makes Unit VI far more concrete

**Common misconceptions to correct early:**
- SFMLDS: "Higher R² always means a better model" (ignores overfitting).
- AISC: "Fuzzy logic is the same as probability" (it isn't — fuzzy is about vagueness of a value, probability is about likelihood of an event).
- ASD: "Agile means no planning/no documentation" (it means adaptive planning, not none).
- CN: "The OSI model is what the internet actually runs on" — it doesn't; the internet runs on TCP/IP. OSI is a *teaching/reference* model. This distinction is asked constantly and frequently gotten wrong.

**Practical applications:**
- SFMLDS → analyzing any real dataset.
- AISC → your on-ramp to actual deep learning frameworks.
- ASD → apply Scrum/Kanban to your own project builds.
- CN → genuinely foundational for any backend, DevOps, cloud, or security role — you cannot debug a production system without understanding what Unit II–IV actually teach you.

**Recommended projects:**
1. A small end-to-end ML pipeline (SFMLDS + AISC neural nets) on an open dataset.
2. A tiny rule-based + fuzzy logic system (e.g., an AC temperature controller simulator) for AISC Unit IV.
3. Run one sprint of a real personal project using actual Scrum ceremonies — reinforces ASD practically.
4. Set up a small home-lab network simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3, both free) implementing subnetting, static/dynamic routing, and a basic VPN — turns CN Units II, III, and VI from theory into something you've actually built.

| **Computer Networks (CN)** | Neso Academy — Computer Networks playlist (one of the most complete free CN video series available); Gate Smashers CN playlist | "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" (Kurose & Ross) — gold standard, check for a free PDF via your library access | Your syllabus's own self-learning links (Google DNS, SD-WAN) | GeeksforGeeks Computer Networks section (excellent for subnetting practice); Cisco Packet Tracer (free) for hands-on routing | University PYQs — CN is one of the most established, PYQ-rich subjects in any CS-adjacent curriculum |

---

# 9. Weekly Plan

**Recommended default: the 60-day plan.** Realistically, most students genuinely start focused exam prep about a month before the exam window opens, after unit tests wrap up — the 30-day plan below is your safety net if that's how it goes, and the 60-day plan is what you should actually aim to start on, since it gives real breathing room without demanding a full-semester commitment you're unlikely to sustain from day one.

## 60-Day Plan (Recommended Default)
- **Daily hours:** 3–3.5 hrs
- **Weeks 1–2:** SFMLDS I→II→V, AISC I→II, ASD I→II, CN I→II (per Section 7 sequence)
- **Weeks 3–4:** SFMLDS III→IV, AISC III→IV, ASD III→IV, CN III→IV — 1 mock test per subject at end of week 4
- **Weeks 5–6:** SFMLDS VI, AISC V→VI, ASD V→VI, CN V→VI
- **Weeks 7–8:** Week 7 = redo all high-ROI units + practice numericals (subnetting, CRC/Hamming, regression metrics); Week 8 = 4 full mock exams (one per subject) + targeted weak-area repair
- **Revision rhythm throughout:** every Sunday = 1 hr recap of that week's hardest unit only (spaced repetition, not full re-read)

## 30-Day Plan (Crash / Safety Net)
- **Daily hours:** 4–5 hrs
- **Week 1:** SFMLDS I, IV, VI + AISC I, II + CN I, II
- **Week 2:** ASD I, II, V, VI + CN III + SFMLDS III
- **Week 3:** AISC IV, V + CN IV, V, VI — full timed past paper every weekend
- **Week 4:** Revision only — every comparison table, every "must never skip" item, 2 full mock tests, error-log review

## 90-Day Plan (Extended, Optional)
Only worth using if you're genuinely starting at the very beginning of the semester with no other pressure. Otherwise the 60-day plan above covers the same ground with less risk of losing momentum partway through.
- **Month 1:** SFMLDS I→II→V, AISC I→II, ASD I→II, CN I→II
- **Month 2:** SFMLDS III→IV, AISC III→IV, ASD III→IV, CN III→IV — timed past-paper section every 2 weeks
- **Month 3:** SFMLDS VI, AISC V→VI, ASD V→VI, CN V→VI, then 2 full weeks of pure revision + 4 full mock papers before the exam window opens

---

# 10. Reality Check

- **Bad syllabus design:** None of the four subjects teaches Git/GitHub, Docker, or SQL — all genuinely expected at internship level, none covered anywhere in this semester.
- **Outdated/misplaced topics:** AISC's Unit VI ANFIS/hybrid systems is a niche academic-research topic rarely used in mainstream industry AI work today. CN's core protocol stack (Units I–V), by contrast, has aged extremely well — TCP/IP fundamentals are as relevant in 2026 as they were 20 years ago.
- **Missing industry-relevant skills:** Cloud networking specifics (AWS VPC, security groups, load balancers) build directly on CN Unit VI but aren't covered explicitly — worth a few hours of self-study given how directly it extends what you're already learning.
- **Most useful for real-world skills, not just exams:** CN Units II–IV (you cannot debug real infrastructure without them), SFMLDS Units III/IV, ASD Unit VI DevOps.
- **Mostly useful only for passing university exams:** AISC Units III and VI, ASD Unit I's historical SDLC model comparisons, CN's more obscure legacy protocol details (older WAN technologies mentioned only in passing).

---

# 11. Previous Year Question (PYQ) Intelligence

**Caveat carried over from the original research pass:** your NEP syllabus is new, so exact-code PYQs don't exist yet for SFMLDS, AISC, or ASD — see the mapping and verified findings below, unchanged from the original research. Computer Networks is different: it's one of the most long-established, consistently-examined subjects in any Indian CS/IT-adjacent curriculum, so while this section doesn't include a fresh live-search pass for CN specifically (per your instruction to keep this subject's research lighter), the general pattern is safe to state with high confidence without needing subject-specific verification: **subnetting/CIDR numericals, OSI vs TCP/IP comparisons, CRC/Hamming code problems, and routing protocol comparisons (RIP vs OSPF vs BGP) are near-universal recurring question types for Computer Networks at any Indian university**, because these are the structural core of the subject itself, not curriculum-specific trivia. Treat this as high-confidence general knowledge rather than a verified Mumbai-University-specific statistic.

## 11.1 Statistics for ML & Data Science
Verified: papers exist for Nov 2023, Dec 2023, May 2024, Jun 2024, and Jun 2025 sessions under the R-19 equivalent "Statistics for AI & DS" (code 48815). Verbatim question content was paywalled/blocked at every source checked — topic weighting is confirmed, exact recurring questions are not.

## 11.2 Artificial Intelligence & Soft Computing
Classical AI (search, logic, agents) has real multi-year precedent under R-19 "Artificial Intelligence" (code 48813). Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks are effectively untested territory — NEP merged two previously-separate R-19 subjects, so there's no reliable trend to lean on for Units IV–VI.

## 11.3 Agile Software Development & DevOps
Insufficient verified Mumbai-University-specific data. DevOps has zero R-19 precedent at all. Expect the "explain & differentiate" question style to carry over from Software Engineering-family papers, but don't lean on a specific predicted pattern.

## 11.4 Computer Networks — General High-Confidence Pattern
| Topic | Confidence | Typical Question Style |
|---|---|---|
| Subnetting / CIDR numericals | Very High | Given an IP block, calculate subnets/hosts — appears in nearly every CN paper at every Indian university |
| OSI vs TCP/IP model | Very High | Compare-and-contrast, often with a diagram |
| CRC / Hamming code numericals | High | Given a bit string, compute the code/detect the error |
| Routing protocol comparison (RIP/OSPF/BGP, Distance Vector vs Link State) | High | Differentiate + short numerical trace |
| TCP vs UDP | High | Compare-and-contrast |
| Application layer protocols (DNS, HTTP, SMTP) | Medium | Short definitional/working questions |
| SDN / NFV / Data Center Networks | Medium — genuinely newer content, less multi-year precedent | Conceptual, likely to grow in weight over time as it's current industry practice |
